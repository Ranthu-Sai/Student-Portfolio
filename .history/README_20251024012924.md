# Student Portfolio (JS/JSX)

This is a React portfolio built with JavaScript/JSX. Components live under `components/`, the theme context under `contexts/`, and custom hooks under `hooks/`.

## Introduction

A clean, fast, and modern student portfolio template built with React + Vite. It’s designed to help you showcase your skills, projects, education, and certifications with minimal setup. You can customize content via simple files, toggle themes, and deploy to GitHub Pages in minutes.

## Project overview

- App type: Single Page Application (SPA) powered by Vite for instant dev server and optimized builds
- UI building blocks: Reusable React components for each section (Hero, About, Education, Projects, Certifications, Tech Stack, Resume, Contact, Footer)
- Theming: Global light/dark theme via a React Context (`contexts/ThemeContext.jsx`)
- Motion: Scroll-based reveal animations via a custom hook (`hooks/useScrollReveal.js`)
- Config & content: Personal info and site settings are sourced from `metadata.json` and `config/app.config.js`

### Features

- Fast local dev with Vite and hot module replacement (HMR)
- Responsive layout that looks good on mobile and desktop
- Light/dark theme toggle via context
- Subtle scroll reveal animations
- Simple, file-based customization (no backend required)
- Ready-to-ship CI for GitHub Pages

### Tech stack

- React (JS/JSX)
- Vite (bundler/dev server)
- Modern JavaScript, CSS

### Folder structure (essentials)

```
components/        Reusable UI sections (Hero, About, Projects, ...)
contexts/          App-wide providers (ThemeContext)
hooks/             Custom hooks (useScrollReveal)
config/            App-level configuration (app.config.js)
index.html         Vite HTML entry
index.jsx          App bootstrap
App.jsx            Root component
metadata.json      Your profile, socials, and site metadata
styles.css         Global styles
vite.config.js     Vite configuration
```

### Customize your portfolio

- Edit `metadata.json` to set your name, title, socials, and other profile data
- Tweak site options in `config/app.config.js` (e.g., section toggles)
- Update content/markup in the components under `components/`
- Adjust styling in `styles.css` or add component-scoped styles as needed

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+ and npm

Install and run locally (Windows cmd):

```cmd
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build and preview production:

```cmd
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Entry point: `index.html` boots `/index.jsx`.


## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repo includes an Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that:

- Builds the site with Vite
- Automatically computes the correct `base` path for Pages
- Publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` or `master`

### 1) Push to a GitHub repo

```cmd
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2) Enable Pages

- In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions
- On your next push to `main`, the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow will run and publish the site

The workflow auto-detects whether the repo is a user/org site (`<user>.github.io`, base `/`) or a project site (base `/<repo>/`). No manual `vite.config.js` changes are required.

 

## Troubleshooting

- Assets 404 on GitHub Pages: ensure Pages is enabled via GitHub Actions, and that the workflow completed successfully.
- Wrong asset paths on Pages: confirm the site URL is `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` (project site). The workflow injects the correct `--base` automatically.
- Local dev errors: try clearing caches and reinstalling.

```cmd
rd /s /q node_modules
del /q package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```
