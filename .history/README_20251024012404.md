# Student Portfolio (JS/JSX)

This is a React portfolio built with JavaScript/JSX. Components live under `components/`, the theme context under `contexts/`, and custom hooks under `hooks/`.

## Introduction

This project is a clean, fast, and customizable portfolio site built with React and Vite. It’s designed to help students and early‑career developers present their work, education, and skills with confidence. The codebase favors small, focused components, sensible defaults, and accessibility‑friendly patterns so you can tailor the look and content without wrestling the framework.

Whether you want a quick start for a hackathon resume, a course project showcase, or a personal site you’ll grow over time, this template gives you a solid foundation that deploys in minutes.

## Project overview

Here’s a quick snapshot of what’s inside and how it’s organized:

- Core sections and components:
	- Hero, Header, Footer for site chrome and identity
	- About, Projects, Education, Certifications, Tech Stack to highlight achievements and skills
	- Resume (download/view) and Contact to make outreach easy
	- LoadingScreen and Section wrappers for smooth transitions and layout consistency
- UX details:
	- Scroll‑reveal animations via a simple custom hook (`hooks/useScrollReveal.js`)
	- Section‑based navigation with a tidy component structure
	- Responsive styles tuned for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Theming:
	- Light/dark theme powered by a dedicated context (`contexts/ThemeContext.jsx`)
- Tooling:
	- Vite for instant dev, fast HMR, and small production bundles
	- Simple configuration under `config/app.config.js`
- Folder layout:
	- `components/` UI building blocks
	- `contexts/` app‑wide state (e.g., theme)
	- `hooks/` reusable behavior (e.g., scroll reveal)
	- Top‑level `index.html` + `index.jsx` as the entry points
- Deployment:
	- Ready for GitHub Pages out of the box via the included Actions workflow; base paths are computed automatically for user or project pages

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+ and npm

Install and run locally (Windows cmd):

```cmd
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build and preview production:

```cmd
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Entry point: `index.html` boots `/index.jsx`.


## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repo includes an Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that:

- Builds the site with Vite
- Automatically computes the correct `base` path for Pages
- Publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` or `master`

### 1) Push to a GitHub repo

```cmd
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2) Enable Pages

- In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions
- On your next push to `main`, the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow will run and publish the site

The workflow auto-detects whether the repo is a user/org site (`<user>.github.io`, base `/`) or a project site (base `/<repo>/`). No manual `vite.config.js` changes are required.

 

## Troubleshooting

- Assets 404 on GitHub Pages: ensure Pages is enabled via GitHub Actions, and that the workflow completed successfully.
- Wrong asset paths on Pages: confirm the site URL is `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` (project site). The workflow injects the correct `--base` automatically.
- Local dev errors: try clearing caches and reinstalling.

```cmd
rd /s /q node_modules
del /q package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```
