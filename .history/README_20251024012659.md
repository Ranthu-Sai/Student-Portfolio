# Student Portfolio (JS/JSX)

This is a React portfolio built with JavaScript/JSX. Components live under `components/`, the theme context under `contexts/`, and custom hooks under `hooks/`.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+ and npm

Install and run locally (Windows cmd):

```cmd
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build and preview production:

```cmd
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Entry point: `index.html` boots `/index.jsx`.


## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repo includes an Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that:

- Builds the site with Vite
- Automatically computes the correct `base` path for Pages
- Publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` or `master`

### 1) Push to a GitHub repo

```cmd
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2) Enable Pages

- In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions
- On your next push to `main`, the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow will run and publish the site

The workflow auto-detects whether the repo is a user/org site (`<user>.github.io`, base `/`) or a project site (base `/<repo>/`). No manual `vite.config.js` changes are required.

 

## Troubleshooting

- Assets 404 on GitHub Pages: ensure Pages is enabled via GitHub Actions, and that the workflow completed successfully.
- Wrong asset paths on Pages: confirm the site URL is `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` (project site). The workflow injects the correct `--base` automatically.
- Local dev errors: try clearing caches and reinstalling.

```cmd
rd /s /q node_modules
del /q package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```
